- Be smart with parenthesis when generating C code

- Make "error" something sane and catcheable

- Define precisely what arrays mean, and if they can be composed of more
  comples types or not

- Maybe add a permutation type

- Coallesce operations made of ~, &, |, ^ and + into a single function,
  to improve speed. This shouldn't be super hard.
