- Make "error" something sane and catcheable

- Define precisely what arrays mean, and if they can be composed of more
  complex types or not.

- Keep in mind the difference between static and dynamic variables.
  This is especially important for arrays, since the can be statically
  initialized on some places and not in others.

- Consider add a permutation type.

- Coallesce operations made of ~, &, |, ^ and + into a single function,
  to improve speed. This shouldn't be super hard.

- Handle small buffers more efficiently by keeping them in words.
