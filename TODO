- Think some more about type mapping. Is it always possible to have
  a one-to-one map? If not, what can we assume?

- Fix every FIXME

- Be smart with parenthesis when generating C code

- Think about how to allow for newlines on array declarations,
  like in the DES goal.

- Check that all possible paths in a function return something or 
  call "error"

- Make "error" something sane and catcheable

- Free memory when variables go out of scope

- Define precisely what arrays mean, and if they can be composed of more
  comples types or not

- Maybe add a permutation type

- Coallesce operations made of ~, &, |, ^ and + into a single function,
  to improve speed. This shouldn't be super hard.
